# Sixth-Sense-Technology-Paint-Tool-Box-and-Gestured-Based-Game-
Inspired from Pranav Mistry, the team has decided to do something different with using the sixth sense technology idea, so we have developed the Paint tool box created in python language with the help of Open CV library in which with the Hand Gestures we can draw any object, erase it or even fill the colors or change the colors with it, basically it requires Numpy, Scipy and PiCamera library module and of course Open CV too, and the another application was the snake game using the gesture of the Hand and it's actually replica of the snake game just major difference is that without the using touch screen or buttons, with using only hand gestures we can move the snakes, and it's pretty cool.
